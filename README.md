# Project - Who Wants to be a Tandem Quiz Millionaire? 

## Description ##
My project is a multiple choice type of trivia game, where the user is given a question and four potential answers. For each question, there will be a set amount of time that the user will have, in order to answer. Throughout the game, the user will have 3 life lines, in which they can use, for additional help. At the end of the game, the user will have a final score based on number of questions they answered correctly, as well as the duration in which it took to complete the entire quiz.
